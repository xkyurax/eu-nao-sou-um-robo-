Prove que voc√™ n√£o √© um rob√¥ selecionando o valor hexadecimal correto. Eu criei esse projeto seguindo o curso "30 HTML CSS & JavaScript projects in 30 Days for Beginners" da Udemy, fiz algumas altera√ß√µes que juguei necess√°rias alterando as cores, fonte e alinhamento de alguns elementos.

Prove that you are not an robot selecting the correct hexadecimal value. This project was created by me following the "30 HTML CSS & JavaScript projects in 30 Days for Beginners" course by udemy but i did some color and align changes. I'm not a native english speaker as you see but i translated some comments in the JavaScript if you have any problem to understand what i was doing.
